# notes
- Ample evidence exists for non-Poisson behaviour on faults or within fault 
  zones; faults may be more periodic or less, and many fault zones show 
  evidence for clustering. This behavior may not be well-described by common 
  recurrence probability models. It may therefore be desirable to construct 
  empirical models from paleoseismic data that incorporate dating uncertainty.
  Additionally these techniques allow us to characterize the recurrence 
  behavior as it pertains to clustering and periodicity in a manner that 
  incorporates the uncertainties and data relationships embedded in the 
  paleoseismic datasets.

- These empirical recurrence models imply alternate descriptions of earthquake 
  hazard than standard recurrence models (Poisson, BPT, Weibull, etc.). However 
  by using simple and well-developed tools of survival analysis (common in 
  biology, medicine, engineering) we can develop time-dependent earthquake 
  hazard models that are derived directly from the underlying datasets, making 
  a minimum of assumptions. Using survival analysis we can also answer basic 
  questions about conditional earthquake likelihoods (i.e. time-dependent 
  earthquake hazard).
