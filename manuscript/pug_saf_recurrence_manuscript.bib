	abstract = {In lifetesting, medical follow-up, and other fields the observation of the time of occurrence of the event of interest (called a death) may be prevented for some of the items of the sample by the previous occurrence of some other event (called a loss). Losses may be either accidental or controlled, the latter resulting from a decision to terminate certain observations. In either case it is usually assumed in this paper that the lifetime (age at death) is independent of the potential loss time; in practice this assumption deserves careful scrutiny. Despite the resulting incompleteness of the data, it is desired to estimate the proportion P(t) of items in the population whose lifetimes would exceed t (in the absence of such losses), without making any assumption about the form of the function P(t). The observation for each item of a suitable initial event, marking the beginning of its lifetime, is presupposed. For random samples of size N the product-limit ({PL}) estimate can be defined as follows: List and label the N observed lifetimes (whether to death or loss) in order of increasing magnitude, so that one has 0 ≤ t$_{\textrm{1}}$' ≤ t$_{\textrm{2}}$' ≤ ⋯ ≤ t$_{\textrm{N}}$'. Then {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}hat\{P\}(t) = {\textbackslash}prod\_r {\textbackslash}lbrack(N - r)/(N - r + 1){\textbackslash}rbrack\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}, where r assumes those values for which t$_{\textrm{r}}$' ≤ t and for which t$_{\textrm{r}}$' measures the time to death. This estimate is the distribution, unrestricted as to form, which maximizes the likelihood of the observations. Other estimates that are discussed are the actuarial estimates (which are also products, but with the number of factors usually reduced by grouping); and reduced-sample ({RS}) estimates, which require that losses not be accidental, so that the limits of observation (potential loss times) are known even for those items whose deaths are observed. When no losses occur at ages less than t, the estimate of P(t) in all cases reduces to the usual binomial estimate, namely, the observed proportion of survivors.},

	abstract = {We show analytically that the answer to the question, (can it be that) “The longer it has been since the last earthquake, the longer the expected time till the next?” depends crucially on the statistics of the fluctuations in the interval times between earthquakes. The periodic, uniform, semi-Gaussian, Rayleigh, and truncated statistical distributions of interval times, as well as the Weibull distributions with exponent greater than 1, all have decreasing expected time to the next earthquake with increasing time since the last one, for long times since the last earthquake; the lognormal and power-law distributions and the Weibull distributions with exponents smaller than 1 have increasing times to the next earthquake as the elapsed time since the last increases, for long elapsed times. There is an identifiable crossover between these models, which is gauged by the rate of fall-off of the long-term tail of the distribution in comparison with an exponential fall-off. The response to the question for short elapsed times is also evaluated. The lognormal and power-law distributions give one response for short elapsed times and the opposite for long elapsed times. Even the sampling of a finite number of intervals from a Poisson distribution will lead to an increasing estimate of time to the next earthquake for increasing elapsed time since the last one.},

	abstract = {Failure Rate Modelling for Reliability and Risk focuses on reliability theory and, specifically, on the failure rate (the hazard rate, the force of mortality) modelling and its generalizations, on systems operating in a random environment and on repairable systems. The failure rate is one of the crucial probabilistic characteristics for a number of disciplines; including reliability, survival analysis, risk analysis and demography. Failure Rate Modelling for Reliability and Risk presents a systematic study of the failure rate and related indices, and covers a number of important applications where the failure rate plays the major role. Applications in engineering systems are studied, together with some actuarial, biological and demographic examples. Covering material previously available only in the journal literature, Failure Rate Modelling for Reliability and Risk provides a survey of this broad and interdisciplinary subject which will be invaluable to researchers and advanced students in reliability engineering and applied statistics, as well as to demographers, econometricians, actuaries and many other mathematically oriented researchers.},

	abstract = {While active upper-crustal faulting in the Cascadian forearc has long 
been recognized, analysis of {LiDAR} topographic data has allowed for the
construction of a fairly complete record of surface faulting of the  16
ka glacial landscape of the Puget Lowland ({WA}). We have recently
compiled all of the existing age data and refined the estimates of
timing for each event in {OxCal} through synthesis of the paleoearthquake
sequences at 68 trenches. We then performed a Monte Carlo analysis of
the earthquake history by creating millions of synthetic earthquake
histories from direct sampling of the earthquake timing probability
density functions; in this way we are able to explore the dataset while
accounting for the uncertainty in each event. A striking feature of the
earthquake history is the highly irregular strain release over the
Holocene; the region seems to undergo long periods of seismic quiescence
punctuated by episodes of more intense earthquake activity. These
temporal clusters of earthquakes involve faults throughout the Puget
Lowland and are not restricted to certain faults or sub-regions. The
regional earthquake recurrence interval probability shows a mode at
20-50 years, which then declines monotonically to  5,000 years. This
very short mode is a sign of earthquake clustering, which may reflect
static or dynamic earthquake triggering by other events. Furthermore, it
strongly suggests that the earthquake hazard following a moderate to
large earthquake in the region will remain elevated for decades
afterward. We are now focusing on the probabilistic reconstruction of
the rupture extents and magnitudes of all the paleoearthquakes in the
dataset through analysis of {LiDAR}- and trench-derived displacement
measurements and fault characteristics. This will allow us to better
understand regional strain rates and earthquake frequency-magnitude
relationships, and allow for physical as well as statistical modeling of
earthquake clustering.},
